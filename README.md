# fountain

A cube-based fountain that works on Soho Plaza. It includes P2P sync and handling of multiple animations per model.

Each one of the four rings has three different animations. These can either be triggered by the buttons or are triggered randomly if the buttons aren't being used.

It could also be programmed with a sequence of animations that follows music, like a dancing fountain.
